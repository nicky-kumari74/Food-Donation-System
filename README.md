# Food Donation Management System
A Food Donation Management System is a platform designed to facilitate the collection, distribution, and management of surplus food to help reduce food waste and combat hunger. It connects donors (restaurants, individuals, organizations) with recipients (NGOs, food banks, and individuals in need), ensuring an efficient and ethical redistribution of food resources.
